We've all felt the crunch of deadlines and work piling up,  as we balance the working world and the life we're meant to live. In this busy, always-on environment, I am a big fan of getting things done. I am also open to suggestions. In an effort to improve my productivity I went to the "experts" that I found online, namely <a title="lifehack - waste time mining for precious little gold" href="http://www.lifehack.org/" target="_blank">lifehack</a>--a website touting useful resources in personal productivity. However, the official <a title="do not waste your time by checking the lifehack blog =)" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/blog/">lifehack blog</a> fills with overblown, verbose posts like <a title="zzz" href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/big-blokes-in-skirts.html" target="_blank">this one</a> that took me minutes to read and essentially said... well, nothing.

I prefer the minimalistic approach of <a title="say it in five sentences" href="http://five.sentenc.es/">http://five.sentenc.es</a> who practice what they preach. We as information consumers should not support these modern-day Dickens who write like they're paid by the word. Even worse are the wolves-in-sheep-clothing producers who waste your time instead of improving your efficiency. In the interest of not wasting your time, I'm done with this rant now.
