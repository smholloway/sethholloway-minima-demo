Does anyone know of a website or method to be notified when your favorite artist is coming to town?

For example, I'd love to see <a title="Mike Doughty" href="http://www.mikedoughty.com/" target="_blank">Mike Doughty</a>, <a title="Ben Folds" href="http://www.benfolds.com/" target="_blank">Ben Folds</a>, and <a title="They Might Be Giants... or..." href="http://www.tmbg.com/" target="_blank">They Might Be Giants</a> in concert, but I always miss the ticket sales. I've tried to check their websites periodically, but I forget for a few months then miss the show. I've listened for announcements on the radio, but I do not listen to the radio consistently enough. Most recently, I've subscribed to RSS feeds from my favorite artists and this method is working, although I feel it is suboptimal.

My brother just mentioned a similar experience where he missed seeing the guitar-thumping virtuoso <a title="Andy McKee" href="http://www.andymckee.com/" target="_blank">Andy McKee</a>. (If you don't know what I mean when I say "guitar-thumping virtuoso," check Andy out below.)

While not the pressing issue in the world, not receiving relevant and timely updates for artists seems to be a common issue. Is there a solution? Show your 1337ness and help me out. Any tips would be appreciated!
