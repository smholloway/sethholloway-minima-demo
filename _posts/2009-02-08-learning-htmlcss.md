Are you new to HTML/CSS? Knowing the basics of HTML/CSS is extremely useful. Below are a couple options to get started in learning HTML/CSS. There are great resources freely available at <a title="HTML Dog" href="http://htmldog.com/" target="_blank">http://htmldog.com/</a> and <a title="W3 Schools" href="http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/" target="_blank">http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/.</a>

So you understand there are tags opened and closed with angled brackets, "&lt;" and "&gt;", now what? To create your site you have two main options:
1) SSH in and poke around. Edit files with your favorite editor (nano, pico, vi, etc.).

2) Modify files locally. This can be done easily two ways:
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">2a) Download the Web Developer Toolbar addon for Firefox: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60" target="_blank">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60</a> then restart Firefox. Now you can use the toolbar to Edit CSS and Edit <span class="nfakPe">HTML</span> on any page you view. To edit CSS: right click a page-&gt;Web Developer-&gt;CSS-&gt;Edit CSS. To edit <span class="nfakPe">html</span>: right click a page-&gt;Web Developer-&gt;Miscellaneous-&gt;Edit <span class="nfakPe">HTML</span>. If you find a configuration you prefer, press the save button and keep a copy locally. When you're satisfied, copy your copy to the server (scp, ftp, WinSSH, etc.).</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">2b) Right click on the web page and choose "View Page Source" to get the <span class="nfakPe">html</span> page you're currently viewing. For a pure <span class="nfakPe">html</span> page, this will give you everything you need to know. It does not work as well on pages generated by web programming languages (for example, viewing the source of a google page gives you near-nonsense because they've obfuscated the details with their Python generation). This method will work perfectly for the SSE page,  <a href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/SSE.css" target="_blank">http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/</a>. With the <span class="nfakPe">html</span> page in view, you should be able to find a style declaration. In the SSE index.<span class="nfakPe">html</span> you'll see</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> <em>&lt;<span>style</span><span> media</span>=<span>"screen" </span><span>title</span>=<span>"currentStyle" </span><span>type</span>=<span>"text/css"</span>&gt;@import "SSE.css";&lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;</em></span></div></blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">So point your browser to the indicated style file; in this case <a href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/SSE.css" target="_blank">http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/SSE.css</a>. You'll then have the style files.</div>
Now you're on your way to figuring out the Internet! View and edit your favorite pages or create your own. If you see something you like, view the HTML/CSS and learn! It's quick, easy, and useful. Good luck!

Did I miss something? Was this useful? How did you learn HTML/CSS?
