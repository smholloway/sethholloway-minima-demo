[The Legacy: Legend of Drizzt, Book VII by R.A. Salvatore](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786948590/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=theven01-20&linkId=AZ5FVM3FFEBFYLZO). It's Drizzt--what's not to like? I previously read books one and two; I mistakenly bought this one thinking it was three (it is actually 7). On the plus side, I can probably skip ahead in the story now that I know what happens after the books I missed!

[Outlander by Diana
Gabaldon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC2L1O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=theven01-20&linkId=4ANBLIVMQ7652A5D). Andrea loved this series and wanted to know if I would like it too. I did not, but I cannot say why. There was a lot of sex, but plenty of books I like have sex; there was romance that did not resonate with me; there was a lot of history, which I must admit I don't care about. I guess I would rather read about a badass Drow ranger defeating a golem than read about a woman lost in time.

[The Dracula Chronicles: The Lamb of
God by Shane KP Oneill](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EN4Q8OQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=theven01-20&linkId=YF3QF5TEVNFXRHAM). This was a very quick read that introduces Dracula. The first book published in this series takes place well after this prequel, but I thought it would be good to start at the beginning. It was good, so I plan to continue this series after I finish some other books.

[Across the Nightingale
Floor by Lian Hearn](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OCXG4Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=theven01-20&linkId=MTDSUNBSKW7ZSQGP). An orphan assassin, sword-fighting, revenge and rebellion--I like it!

[The Wealth of Nations by Adam
Smith](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JVST6CA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=theven01-20&linkId=EWWY3DMHY2TQBT7R). I've heard a ton about this book, and I'd like to have a better grasp on economics. It started off well; Smith lays the foundation of economics and currency, and it is brilliant, logical stuff. That being said, I ultimately abandoned the book about 1/6th of the way in when the author stated how much tobacco you should expect a negro between sixteen and sixty years to pick. I know that in 1776 statements like that were not in poor taste--Smith was likely very progressive--but one too many outdated terms made me question how applicable the book truly is. I include the book in this list because I don't plan to finish it.
