Dave DeAngelis, an <a title="Dave DeAngelis research page" href="http://www.ddeangelis.com/" target="_blank">awesome researcher</a> and <a title="Dave DeAngelis blog" href="http://www.nameofscience.com/" target="_blank">great friend</a>, recently showed me the <a title="Pitchfork 500" href="http://thepitchfork500.com/" target="_blank">Pitchfork 500</a> playlist on everyone's favorite Internet jukebox, <a title="Grooveshark" href="http://listen.grooveshark.com/" target="_blank">Grooveshark</a>. The Pitchfork 500 is actually a 500 song review from the music geniuses at <a title="Pitchfork" href="http://www.pitchfork.com" target="_blank">Pitchfork.com</a>; Grooveshark allows users to create and share playlists, so people have taken the review and created the accompanying playlist.

For the past week I've been listening to the 500 song playlist that covers virtually every musical style from 1978 to now. I'm deleting roughly 1/2 the songs, but I'm discovering a lot of great new stuff, old favorites, and deeper tracks from bands that I knew little about. If you're looking to find some new music or you want to enjoy a wide variety of old favorites, give it a listen.
