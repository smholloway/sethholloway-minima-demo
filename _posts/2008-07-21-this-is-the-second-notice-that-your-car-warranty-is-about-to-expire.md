Over the past six months I have been getting roughly one call per day from random 800 numbers from all over the country. The voice changes, but the message is always the same: 'This is the second notice that your car warranty is about to expire.'

I've spoken to other people who are also getting the calls. A friend of mine just bought a car and is receiving these ominous messages which cannot be true.

The worst part is that I'm on the <a title="block phone spam" href="https://www.donotcall.gov/" target="_blank">National Do Not Call Registry</a> which should protect me from these unwanted phone calls. Does anyone know of a class action lawsuit against the filth behind these calls? Does anyone know how to file a class action lawsuit...

Edit: Thanks for pointing out the typo Jason :)
