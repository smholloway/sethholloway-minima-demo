February's focus was on finishing The Wheel of Time series, but I snuck
in a couple other books.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0080K3G4O/?tag=theven01-20">The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking</a> by Oliver Burkeman. Burkeman played a nice angle in this contrarian's guide to happiness. He synthesized a fair amount of information and presented his path to happiness.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003E749TE/?tag=theven01-20">The Happiness Hypothesis</a> by Jonathan Haidt. This book was almost like a scientific version of The Antidote: where The Antidote is a story, The Happiness Hypothesis is a pop science textbook. Haidt did a fantastic job combining psychology and philosophy along with history and his own story. His metaphor for your mind, the elephant and the rider, is amazing. Basically, your rational mind, the rider, isn't really in control of your body, the elephant. For too long, people have thought of their mind and body like a car: you go left when you want to go left, right when you want to go right, and over a cliff if that's what you desire. But Haidt points out that you reflexively jump when you see a snake and automatically recoil from a hot surface--your body acts before your mind can process the event. Haidt suggests this is because your body has evolved to survive for much longer than your brain has. You can drive a car off a cliff, but you can't easily ride a horse off a cliff. Haidt extends the idea and suggests that we are emotional creatures who often wrap our feelings with rational alibis. The book covers a lot of neat studies and compares modern thought to historical perspectives.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003P8Q5QC/?tag=theven01-20">Towers of Midnight (The Wheel of Time Book 13)</a> by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson. Book 12 fed nicely into 13 and I went into the finale with a full head of steam.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BMKDTNC/?tag=theven01-20">A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time Book 14)</a> by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson. How do you end an epic tale? Well, this is one way. I might have liked more information, but I didn't want to read yet another book. I'm happy with Sanderson's tradeoff between quality and time. I'm glad to have closure on the Rand al'Thor saga.
