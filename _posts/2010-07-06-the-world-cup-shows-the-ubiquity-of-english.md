I've been enjoying the World Cup for the past three weeks--while still getting all of my work done, of course. One thing that has been really neat is seeing the diverse cultures communicating. I imagine the players and referees could play without words (we'll let them keep whistles and hand-signs), but very frequently players verbally plead for calls and the ref explicitly announces situations to players. The on-field interactions seem to be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a>.

When Paraguay, coached by an Argentinian, <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=249718/match=300061506/index.html">played</a> Spain, coached by a Spaniard, they were officiated by a Guatemalan, Costa Rican, Honduran, and Mexican; I'd guess everyone spoke Spanish. But the situation gets more complicated if we look at when Paraguay (native Spanish speakers) <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=249717/match=300061497/index.html">played</a> Japan (native Japanese speakers) with refs from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium">Belgium</a> (official languages are Dutch, French, and German). My lip-reading skills are admittedly amateur, but I perceived English. This has been the case throughout the tournament. Now, I'm glad that I focused on furthering my English skills instead of futilely learning a foreign language because everyone speaks English. The World Cup taught me so :-)

So, when and how are players from all of the world learning English well enough to communicate with other similarly diverse English-speakers? When did this start? Because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona">Maradona</a>, an old school footballer, interviews in Spanish using a translator.
