I love Google Reader! I love the format for finding, reading, and sharing news. I also enjoy Google+, but I find that I'd like to discuss Google Reader items more on Google+. Until now, I could not find a way to do so. Frustrated, I decided I'd either find a way or write the extension myself. <a title="Share Google Reader items on Google+" href="http://davidvielmetter.com/tricks/share-google-reader-items-on-google-plus/">David Vielmetter has one solution</a>, and you could probably grab the RSS feed of your shared items then push it to Google+, but that would be a series of hacks. I'm currently testing the <a title="RSS Share for Google Plus and Google Reader" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cngpndgifehgejmkemnmmiknpafnhpec#">RSS Share for Google Plus™ and Google Reader™</a> extension for Chrome, and I think it will do the trick.

Has anyone else figured out a better way?
