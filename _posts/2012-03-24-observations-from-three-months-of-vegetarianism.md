Near the end of 2011 I decided to try a vegetarian diet for a few reasons, including the fact that I don't really care for meat, red and processed meats may cause cancer, I generally wanted to eat healthier, and it'd be nice to lower my carbon footprint. Okay, technically it was not vegetarianism, rather my diet was <a title="Wikipedia: Pescetarianism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pescetarianism">pescatarianism</a>, and more accurately, <a title="Wikipedia: Flexitarianism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-vegetarianism">flexitarianism</a> (I've been largely vegetarian, but chosen to eat meat a few times--mainly when I was really hungry).  After three months, here are some observations (in no particular order):

 * Everyone has thoughts on food and diet. Many people want to understand and define your diet, and they are quick to point out when you're inconsistent ("Sushi?! Aren't you a vegetarian?!"). Several overweight people told me that my choice was wrong or bad.
 * A lot of people mocked vegetarianism, which is somewhat understandable because <a title="Wikipedia: Vegetarianism by country" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_by_country">only about 1/30 people in the US are vegetarian</a>.
 * I actually prefer veggie burgers to traditional meat patties. Veggie burgers can have better flavor and texture than meat patties. As with the old stand-by (beef), there are good and bad versions, but veggie patties have more complexity (probably because of the mixture of ingredients).
 * Most of the time it's pretty easy to be a vegetarian; it is far harder to be a healthy vegetarian. Several times I found myself eating queso or french fries instead of a lower calorie, arguably healthier entree with lean meat. There are a lot of vegetarian options around Austin and most restaurants will provide some meatless alternative, but eating roasted veggies or a bland salad while others chow down on a scrumptious entree just sucks!
 * Sometimes it's nearly impossible to be a vegetarian. A few places just have no vegetarian options! BBQ places may leave you eating nothing but bread--and some only have bread made with lard, so you're left with pickles and onions. In general, ethnic food seems friendlier to the meat-averse. If you're really disciplined you can pack your own food, skip a meal, or demand that you go somewhere else.
 * Animal derived products exist in unexpected places! For example, one of my favorite local Tex-Mex restaurants, Chuy's, uses chicken broth in their queso. As I alluded to above, some places use lard in their bread. A lot of soups and sauces use chicken or beef stock. There's meat or meat flavoring in beans--even traditional caesar salad dressing (anchovies). I rarely inquired as to how vegetarian food items were, choosing instead to go off my previous knowledge as well as the food's appearance and description.
 * Meat eaters also like vegetarian meals. If you eat a family-style meal a lot of people will eat your food even though you choose not to eat theirs! For example, everyone orders a pizza (most have meat) then cheese is the first flavor finished.

That's it for now. Did I miss something? Has anyone else experienced something different?
