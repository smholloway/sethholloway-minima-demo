Yesterday afternoon I proposed my work, "Simplifying the Programming of Intelligent Environments." I passed with a few good suggestions but no major revisions required; I'm told the outcome is about as good as it gets, however, I hope this is not how "as good as it gets" feels. I'm officially ABD (all but dissertation), so the fun begins!

Thanks to everyone who supported me in-person and in-spirit! I'm very lucky to have so many great people in my life.
