I had an idea for a website that would cover one issue per day. Clean and simple; just one issue per day. The idea came after I got frustrated with the amount of clutter on various news sites, and while there is a lot of overlap, to really keep up with the world you have to visit a number of websites per day. Instead, why not have one thoughtful, easy to read post per day. Intellectuals could meet at the water cooler and discuss the topic. We'd gain exposure to important, interesting ideas all through a simple central location.

I never got very far with my project, but Google is doing a similar thing with <a title="Google 10^100" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/project-10100.html" target="_blank">their 10^100 campaign</a>. To celebrate 10 years, Google wants to raise as many helpful ideas as possible. Google and CNN are collaborating, so the star power is there; now we just need some good ideas!
