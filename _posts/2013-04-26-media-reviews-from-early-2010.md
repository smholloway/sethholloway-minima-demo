Yet another post that never got published...

For my own memory as much as anything else, I thought I'd list some of the highlights.
<h2>Books</h2>
<strong>Cryptonomicon</strong> - Neal Stephenson: I conquered this book. Mike graciously presented me with this monster on my birthday last year. After a few months reading slowly, I read more seriously and knocked the book out quickly. Not as good as The Diamond Age, but I always love Stephenson.

<strong>Twilight</strong> - Stephenie Meyers: I think I should be embarrassed that I finished it.

<strong>Blood and Gold</strong> - Ann Rice: I'm a fan of the Vampire Chronicles, but this book was a little too out there for me.
<h2>Movies (in order of preference)</h2>
<strong>Sherlock Holmes</strong>: Just what I need! Another good action/adventure/mystery series. Really great cast (has Robert Downey Jr. done been in a bad movie since his recovery). I hope they make a lot of these!

<strong>Avatar</strong>: Entertaining, yes; deep, no. Watch it in 3D and enjoy.

<strong>Men Who Stare At Goats</strong>: I enjoyed the movie and laughed a lot. I'm not sure it was supposed to be that comical, but I have a thing for "the Dude, man" (Jeff Bridges).
<h2>TV Shows</h2>
<strong>30 Rock</strong>: Hilarious and wonderfully entertaining. This show turns me into that guy--yep, I laugh out loud sitting on the couch with my cat.

<strong>Heroes</strong>: I've now watched every episode (thanks Netflix!). Season 1 was fantastic! Season 2 and 3 were kinda good, however, Season 4 was a let down.

<strong>Californication</strong>: I remember seeing the stories about David Duchovny being a sex addict in real life, which was ironic because that's what he plays in the show. Some said it was just a publicity stunt. I don't know either way, but he's awesome in the show about a vulnerable writer/father/ex struggling to do his best in life.
