After a fantastic summer I'm starting the job hunt, excited for the stability, sociability, and focus. I'd like to stay in Austin and do something cool with software; if you know of any exciting opportunities, <em>please</em> let me know.

I've pasted my resume below in hopes of getting constructive criticism. The formatting is ugly here, so please focus on content and ordering (or any other secret mojo that I may have missed). My resume is alsoÂ available as a standalone document on <a title="Seth Michael Holloway's awesome resume" href="http://sethholloway.com/resume.html">sethholloway.com</a>. Thanks in advance for any feedback! Fire away...
