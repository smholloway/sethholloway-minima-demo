One day I was enjoying a balmy afternoon at <a title="Mozart's Coffee Roasters" href="http://www.mozartscoffee.com/" target="_blank">Mozart's</a> with my wife. While it was not my goal to eavesdrop, I overheard two women talking about finding jobs--a common topic these days. The profound bit that I picked up on was an analogy: finding jobs is like spinning plates. If you apply too much or too little force to a plate, the plate will fall. I think this simple idea applies to all facets of life; once again, moderation is a virtue.
