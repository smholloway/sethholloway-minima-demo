Whenever someone asks you a question there are a range of responses, but in that universe of possibilities there are only three options:

 * lie
 * tell the truth
 * refuse to answer

In refusing to answer I see two approaches, the active and passive:

 * active: something like "that is too personal" or "none of your business"
 * passive: play semantics

Each method has its place. You can learn a lot about yourself and your peers if you observe when and why you (or others) apply these responses.

One of my favorite songs on the subject is <em>Policy of Truth</em> by Depeche Mode with some choice lyrics:

<blockquote>Hide what you have to hide / And tell what you have to tell /
You'll see your problems multiplied / If you continually decide / To faithfully pursue / The policy of truth</blockquote>
