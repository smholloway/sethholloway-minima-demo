I barely hit my goal of four books a month! I continued on the Kingkiller 
Chronicles and finished a couple books from Lois McMaster Bujold, who I learned 
about when looking at [Hugo Fantasy winners](http://sethholloway.com/hugo-award-winners-and-nominees-fantasy/). 
I also fit in one non-fiction book that had been on my "to-read" list for a while.

[The Wise Man's Fear by Patrick Rothfuss](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00475AYJQ/?tag=theven01-20). 
I loved this book, and now I'm ready for book three. Speaking of waiting
for the conclusion of a story, [George R. R. Martin said](http://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/reviews.asp), 
"He's bloody good, this Rothfuss guy." May both Patrick Rothfuss and GRRM finish their series soon!

[The Curse of Chalion by Lois McMaster Bujold](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC11AQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000FC11AQ&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20&linkId=OEM63HL3THDLOU4V). 
I liked this book, but it fell short of what I expected from a Hugo Award winner. 
The story could have been told with many fewer words, although I don't claim to 
know which words needed to be cut. There were some neat concepts; e.g., in this 
universe there are five gods who visit mortals. The gods grant blessings and 
bestow curses. There are also demons that can jump into human hosts and corrupt 
the person from the inside out, while granting some supernatural abilities.

[Paladin of Souls by Lois McMaster Bujold](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC138Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000FC138Q&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20&linkId=SQKW2GDXK57IBB5F). 
I had already completed the first book (The Curse of Chalion), so I continued 
on to this book. I preferred this one, perhaps because the story was richer for 
building on the realm of Chalion, which I had read a whole book about.

[Boys Adrift by Leonard Sax](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097CWIDY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0097CWIDY&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20&linkId=LVHIEKBKBJFQ2V4L). 
I thought this book made some good points, but I was ultimately unconvinced. In 
the introduction, Sax says that on college campuses females outnumber males 2:1; 
however, he also says that college is now 58% female and 42% male. 58:42 is not 
2:1--it's 1.38:1. From this point on, I was much more skeptical of the 
information. Sax' [five factors](http://www.boysadrift.com/factors.php) are 
video games, teaching methods, prescription drugs, endocrine disruptors, and 
devaluation of masculinity; of those, each have some merit, but it felt a bit 
like listening to an old person railing on young people. You know, "back in my 
day, men were men!" The evidence felt like a collection of anecdotes and a lot 
of just-so stories. Some of the ideas came across as shamefully outdated 
opinions, which is unfortunate. Why is it so highly rated? I suspect because 
there's a huge selection bias--people who do not believe boys are adrift simply 
will not read the book.
