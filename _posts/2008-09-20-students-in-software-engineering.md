The Students in Software Engineering continue to go strong! Yesterday we had our third meeting where PhD candidate Chris Jones discussed his work on team formation in dynamic, contractless environments. The talk drew a crowd and inspired a great discussion. Personally, I'm proud and glad to have Chris at UT, and I look forward to following his progress.

In related SSE news, we now haveÂ  a live webpage! Check us out at <a title="Students in Software Engineering" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/" target="_blank">http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/</a>. We're adding content regularly :)
