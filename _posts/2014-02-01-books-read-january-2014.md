With the winter break I was able to read quite a bit! The books were pleasurable though less brainy than previous months.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049B1VOU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theven01-20">The Language Instinct: How The Mind Creates Language (P.S.)</a> - Reading linguistics books is dangerous when you're married to a linguist. Pinker tells an interesting tale, but I wasn't completely convinced. I found the overview of cognitive science studies absolutely brilliant.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DOSBMK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theven01-20">Homeland: The Legend of Drizzt, Book I: Bk. 1</a> - The Drizzt series is very well reviewed, and I understand why. The lowest ratings hint at the fact that the books are pretty simple and thrive in D&amp;D lore. The book is definitely no Diamond Age or Dance with Dragons, but I found it thoroughly enjoyable.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CCNA1K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theven01-20">Exile: The Legend of Drizzt, Book II</a> - More of the same: a straightforward, pleasurable hero story based in D&amp;D universe. The Drizzt series is a nice break from the more involved Wheel of Time.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1477583122/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theven01-20">The Shunned House</a> - I asked friends for fantasy series recommendations and received too many good suggestions. H.P. Lovecraft was one of them, so I found this book and plowed through it. I see why people love Lovecraft! I cannot describe how, but the writing style is so evocative and creepy.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906838356/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theven01-20"> Case of Charles Dexter Ward</a> - Perhaps because I haven't read many graphic novels, or perhaps because I am impatient, I found myself skipping the drawing and going straight for the story. This made for a quick read. Unfortunately, I felt Lovecraft's ability to generate tension and suspense was was hindered by the shortened story.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1444406574/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theven01-20">The Wendigo</a> - Amazon recommended this along when I got the Lovecraft book. I would have liked more description of the Wendigo (and if the story wasn't written a century ago I would have wanted to hear how wendigos are undiscovered), but I liked the book overall.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1587150794/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theven01-20">Fifty-One Tales</a> - This is another recommendation from a friend. Apparently, <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Plunkett,_18th_Baron_of_Dunsany" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Plunkett,_18th_Baron_of_Dunsany">Edward Plunkett a.k.a. Lord Dunsany</a>, is one of the first fantasy authors. While The King of Elfland's Daughter was recommended, I was drawn to this book as an introduction to his style. Of the 51 tales, my favorites were <i>The Workman</i>--about a workman vainly struggling for immortality--and <i>A Moral Little Tale</i>, which says that Puritanical beliefs are actually devilish because God appreciates mirth.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084B5TK8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theven01-20">Dracula</a> - A classic fantasy story that I knew but had not read. I hate redoing things, so reading a story I already knew was challenging; however, the book was good. It unfolds as a series of diary entries, which I thought was unique and clever. I am stunned at the lack of resolution--I feel like the climax is on the penultimate page.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-William-White-Strunk/dp/B000KW42KM/?tag=theven01-20">The Elements of Style (a.k.a. Strunk and White)</a> - This is a short book, but it was not a quick read for me. Between The Language Instinct and conversations with my linguist wife, I have come to realize that I have an elementary understanding of English grammar. Strunk and White often pressed the limits of my knowledge with highfalutin terms like [gerundive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerundive) and [dependent clause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_clause); however, they offer great examples that helped me understand the concepts without mastering the vocabulary.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003K15O3E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theven01-20">The Gathering Storm (The Wheel of Time Book 12)</a> - After a break, I was ready for more Wheel of Time. I read summaries for books 7-11 and jumped straight to the finale, which is written by Brandon Sanderson with the late Robert Jordan's notes. I don't know if it is Sanderson's writing or the fact that the books are rushing towards the end, but I loved this story. I should finish the series in another month.
