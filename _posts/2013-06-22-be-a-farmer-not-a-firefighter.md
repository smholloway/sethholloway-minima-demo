Firefighters sprint from task to task with adrenaline pumping. They achieve great things in very little time. At the other end of the spectrum,Â farmers do a little bit each day. At the end of a season, the work has paid off and farmers have a load of crops; firefighters have a few glorious stories.

<em>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure</em>. Instead of putting out fires, ensure they do not happen. Be proactive instead of reactive--cultivate slowly and steadily and reap the rewards.

Have you ever worked for a firefighter? You're abandoned for long periods of time until your contribution is the only thing in the world that matters. Suddenly, you're supposed to work miracles. When you do, the firefighter is off to the next fire and you're left with little thanks. The farmer keeps things running smoothly and have a more uniform interface.

Have I oversimplified? Is there a second (or third or forth) axis? Can farmers also firefight and vice versa?
