I have a lot of series started now, and I'm not sure which one I will continue next.

[Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KABDMA/ref=as_li_tl?tag=theven01-20). This book is really well written and historically important--the amount of [controversy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic_Verses#Controversy) around this novel is unreal! Unfortunately, I did not care for the book. I made it through about 2/3 before I decided I'd much rather be reading something else. Fear not! I've read the summary so I know how it ends ;-)

[The Legend of Drizzt: The Collected Stories by R.A.
Salvatore](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GLS7SU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005GLS7SU&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20&linkId=DWGB7CV6GVSL3XT7). I always like Drizzt stories. This is a sequence of vignettes that is less interesting than a complete story. It fills some gaps, but also spoils entire books; I'd say you should read it after you've read all the other books.

[Hounded: The Iron Druid Chronicles, Book One by Kevin
Hearne](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J4WN0I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004J4WN0I&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20&linkId=ALNRNFQYLDFTUFJ3). I found this very entertaining; I found it to be an interesting, fresh take on Druidic magic. 

[Storm Front (The Dresden Files, Book 1) by Jim
Butcher](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WH7PLS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000WH7PLS&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20&linkId=FUZ7WVMF7CLGK3WU). A couple years ago I tore through the Dresden Files series on Netflix, so this reading was a long time coming. Unsurprisingly, the book is better than the show, but I'd recommend both.

[Crucial Conversations by Kerry
Patterson](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K0AYH4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005K0AYH4&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20&linkId=4AQUFSLWMQYJDDLC). This is a very useful book that offers "tools for talking when the stakes are high." Some of the biggest takeaways for me: focus on what _you_ can do better and 'start with heart,' that is, be honest and heartfelt without blaming. I plan to re-read again sometime.
