After meeting a III I got interested in nicknames and learned a thing or two. Here's a quick list I compiled from people I've met and information I found on the <a title="Wikipedia: Nickname" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickname">intertubes</a> and <a title="Wikipedia: Suffix" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_(name)">wikifacegoogles</a>.

For the second: Junior, J.R., June, Chip, Duece, Two, Bud, &lt;First name initial&gt;.J. (e.g., Seth Jr. would be S.J.), Little &lt;Name&gt; (e.g., Little Seth), Younger &lt;Name&gt; (e.g., Younger Seth), Skip (particularly if the name skipped a generation), Sonny

For the third: Trip/Tripp, Trey/Tre, Skip/Skipper

Nicknames even extend to IV, V, and beyond! Maybe I would have learned this sooner if I lived with more WASPs in New England :) Have I missed any others?
