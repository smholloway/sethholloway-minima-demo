I am signed up to receive emails about friends with birthdays in the next week. It's a neat service that usually works as expected. This week, the email showed a bit of a bug... can you spot it?

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1098" title="Sorting-Fail" src="/images/facebook-Sorting-Fail.tiff" alt="Whoops! facebook sorted Jan 2011 before Dec 2010" />

I believe that January 2011 should come after December 2010. Whoops! I guess amid the massive innovation, this corner case slipped through.

In any case, happy birthday to Dean and Steve :)
