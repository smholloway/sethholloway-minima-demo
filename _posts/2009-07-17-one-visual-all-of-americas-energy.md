As I've said <a title="Seth Holloway: World Religion Visual" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2009/07/12/world-relgions-visual/" target="_blank">before</a>, I'm a sucker for effective visualizations. In this age of "<a title="Wikipedia: American Energy Independence" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_energy_independence" target="_blank">energy independence</a>" I was really taken aback by this visual: the energy generation, transmission, and consumption in the U.S. Given the complexity of the information and sheer volume of data to present, I think this visual does an excellent job. (Other interesting visuals are available on the Lawrence Livermore site <a title="Energy at Lawrence Livermore" href="https://eed.llnl.gov/flow/" target="_blank">here</a>. Thanks to <a title="Drew Stovall" href="http://www.dstovall.com/" target="_blank">Drew</a> for sharing this with me.)

<a href="https://eed.llnl.gov/flow/images/LLNL_Energy_Chart300.jpg"><img title="Energy Generation, Transmission, and Consumption" src="https://eed.llnl.gov/flow/images/LLNL_Energy_Chart300.jpg" alt="U.S. Energy Generation, Transmission, and Consumption" width="550" height="400" /></a>

Notice how little energy alternative sources are producing. Also, notice that we're losing a ton of energy to transmission. In fact, if we could halve transmission losses we could eliminate all imports.

Does anything else stand out to you? More notable points than mine? Is the graphic missing data that you would like to see? Is energy independence truly achievable?
