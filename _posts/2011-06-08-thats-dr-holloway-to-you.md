This post is a few weeks overdue. On May 20, I officially completed my PhD from The University of Texas at Austin, making me Seth Holloway, PhD. Pretty neat, huh? I have more to say about my work, academia, working while going to school, but it'll have to wait. For now, just a teaser :)

Note: The title is just a joke: I still respond to Seth. I'm looking for more ways to incorporate the Dr. or PhD (or more correctly, Ph.D.), and there really aren't many. At least I'll have this blog post.
