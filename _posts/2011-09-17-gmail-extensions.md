A friend of mine mentioned that he didn't like Gmail's built-in tasks, which prompted me to share a couple Chrome extensions (they exist for Firefox too) that I have come to enjoy. Here they

 * <a title="TaskForce to-do list in Gmail" href="https://www.taskforceapp.com/">TaskForce</a> - a task list that's a little better than Google's default
 * <a title="Rapportive - replace ads with useful information" href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a> - replaces the right sidebar ads with information about the person you're emailing--awesome!
 * <a title="Klout for Rapportive" href="http://kloutlet.com/">Klout raplet</a> - adds the recipient's Klout score at the bottom of the Rapportive sidebar. (Klout is a way of measuring a person's influence on Twitter.)

<div>A friend swears by <a title="Remember the Milk tasks and todos" href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a>, but I'm fine with my current to-do style. Are you using any user scripts or extensions to improve your Gmail? I'd love to hear about it.</div>
