Today is a very exciting day for the <a title="SSE" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/" target="_blank">Students in Software Engineering</a> (SSE)! <a title="Ambler's homepage" href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~ambler/" target="_blank">Chairman Ambler</a> will be presenting today. He is ostensibly the biggest name we have had yet and we expect a large turnout. I hope we got enough food!

In a similar vein, the updated <a title="Software Engineering at UT" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/se/" target="_blank">Software Engineering website</a> is up. I think it looks clean while intuitively presenting all the useful information.

On a completely unrelated note... <a title="Rock Auto" href="https://www.rockauto.com/" target="_blank">Rock Auto part</a>s is an amazing online catalog of (believe it or not) auto parts. I was able to find a random knob for an affordable $6! If you need some parts, check it out.

Also, if you haven't seen this site before, <a title="123People" href="http://www.123people.com/" target="_blank">123 peopl</a>e aggregates online information about people. Apparently I have a web presence that I can be proud of. Do you?
