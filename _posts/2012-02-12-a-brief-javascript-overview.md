I presented <a href="https://docs.google.com/present/embed?id=df9bw4hb_115chv28jfg" title="A Brief Overview of JavaScript by Seth Holloway">a brief overview of JavaScript</a> at work last week. In only 30 minutes I was not able to cover a lot, so I tried to hit the high points. While the presentation was meant to combine with my speech, others may find it useful too.
