As the semester draws to an end, I am pleased with the progress of the <a title="Students in Software Engineering" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/" target="_blank">Students in Software Engineering</a>.Â  Leading the group has been a very rewarding experience for me, and participating has been great! I enjoyed learning more about my peers' research as well as hearing some of the professors' thoughts.

Here are a few statistics from our inaugural semester:

 * Meetings averaged 16 students
 * We averaged a turnout of over 50% of our target audience (Software Engineering graduate students)
 * Over 100 different people came to at least one meeting
 * Hosted the Chairman of the department
 * We filled the room for two meetings
 * There were never any donuts left

I'm very proud to be part of the Students in Software Engineering. The organization has done a phenomenal job of uniting Software Engineers, and we will continue to foster the collaborative, friendly environment. Coming next semester:

 * Greater in-person promotion
 * Meeting format change: three student presentation (reading groups) and one large meeting per month
 * A new website
 * SSE goodies
 * A few other surprises :)

None of this would be possible without the awesome community of students in Software Engineering and my hardworking officers: Justin Enderle, Dave DeAngelis, and Robert Grant. Thanks to you all!
