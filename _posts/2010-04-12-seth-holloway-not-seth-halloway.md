I've long been in the habit of spelling my last name for people after I tell them. Some people reply almost indignantly, "How else would you spell it?!" Well, I set up my <a title="Google Webmaster Tools" href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Webmaster tools</a> and people are stumbling upon the site from the query "<a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth halloway</a>." Perhaps it's time to publish all the common misspellings of my name:

 * <a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth holloway</a>
 * <a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth halloway</a>
 * <a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth hallaway</a>
 * <a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth hollaway</a>

At my first grade graduation, the principal beckoned me across the stage by calling "<a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seeth holloway</a>" and I've been called "<a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">sean holloway</a>" and "<a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">scott holloway</a>!" After attending a diverse graduate program, I have heard some amazing mispronounciations and I know that I have nothing to complain about :)
