After hundreds of hours of development, I'm ready to share more of my entrepreneurial efforts.

<a href="http://oilfieldintelligence.com/">Oilfield Intelligence, a review site for oil and gas service companies</a>, is now in beta!Â A few friends in the oilfield have helped me define the functionality and I believe it is worthwhile. The dream is to be the Yelp of oil and gas :)

Try it and provide us feedback so we can keep improving the look and functionality. If you know anyone in the oil and gas industry, please share the site with them!
