<h2>Sunday</h2>
Continue kicking ass

And you will be rewarded

By life and your peers
<h2>Monday</h2>
Anonymity

Increases your bravery

For better or worse
<h2>Tuesday</h2>
Whoa crazy lady

Are you really afraid of dogs?

No need to freak out
<h2>Wednesday</h2>
Bro, that's not haiku

Moras are not syllables

Pedantic diff'rence
<h2>Thursday</h2>
Mediocrity

Happens all too easily

Eat your own dog food
<h2>Friday</h2>
Exercise takes time

And food is so damn tasty

That's why I am fat
<h2>Saturday</h2>
Home maintenance sucks

Paychecks paid straight to my Lowe's

Days spent in the yard
