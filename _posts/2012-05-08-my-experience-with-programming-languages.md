I was recently browsing a <a title="Rosetta Code: Programming Languages" href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Programming_Languages">list of programming languages on Rosetta Code</a> (there's a <a title="Wikipedia: List of Programming Languages" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages">larger list on Wikipedia</a>) and realized I have played with a lot of languages over the years. I decided to make a list here:

 * Apex (Salesforce.com)
 * AppleScript
 * Assembly (I forget the exact flavors, but there have been a few embedded chips like the Motorola 6812, the LC-2 teaching language, and some in-line C on various AMD and Intel chips)
 * AutoHotKey
 * AWK
 * BASIC
 * Batch
 * C
 * C++
 * C#
 * Clojure
 * CoffeeScript
 * F#
 * Gnuplot
 * Go
 * Groovy
 * Haskell
 * Java
 * JavaScript
 * LabVIEW
 * LaTeX
 * Lisp
 * LotusScript
 * Lua
 * Make
 * Mathematica
 * MATLAB
 * MySQL
 * Objective-C
 * Octave
 * Pascal
 * Perl
 * PHP
 * Python
 * R
 * Ruby
 * Scala
 * Scratch
 * Sed
 * SQL
 * TI-89 BASIC
 * UNIX Shell (sh, Bash) and UNIX Pipes (grep, cat, etc)
 * VBScript
 * VHDL

I haven't written extensively in all of the languages and I doubt I could do much more than 'Hello, World!' (if that) in most, but those are the ones that I remember.

There are a few more that I didn't see while quickly browsing the languages list. For example, I have automated video game playing in the past using languages like UOAssist, Razor, AC Tools, and MMOGlider. One summer at Texas Instruments I wrote statistical algorithms and data mining routines for a specialized spreadsheet language called Informix Wingz/HyperScript Tools/DataPOWER (which now seems to be owned by IBM).

Looking back, I've written in a fair amount of languages, but there's so much to learn and do! I continue to learn and grow as I add links to my <a title="Craftsman chain of improvement" href="http://japhr.blogspot.com/2009/03/my-chain.html">craftsman's chain</a>. My next step is to complete the Programming Languages 101 online course from <a title="Dr. Nathan Whitehead teaches programming languages" href="http://nathansuniversity.com/">Nathan's University</a>. Very cool stuff!

Update: added Assembly and UNIX shell specifics. Added Clojure and Lisp. Added Scala and F#.
