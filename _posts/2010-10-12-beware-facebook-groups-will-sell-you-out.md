This morning I received an email titled
<blockquote>
<h1>Lane added you to the group "Close Friends and Family."</h1>
</blockquote>
Followed shortly thereafter by this one:
<blockquote>
<h1>Lane Holloway changed the name of the group "Close Friends and Family" to "Friends and Family".</h1>
</blockquote>
Opening the emails reveals a link to Facebook. When I asked my brother, he said he had no idea it would email people. Good thing he did not make a group for people he does not like...

<a title="Facebook Blog: Groups" href="http://www.facebook.com/blog.php?post=434700832130" target="_blank">The idea behind</a> <a title="Facebook Groups" href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/" target="_blank">Facebook Groups</a> is good: organize your connections and filter the appropriate information to them; however, I do not like that others would know what group they are in--informing people is a user's choice. By informing people that they won't receive all your updates, you defeat the purpose of selective correspondence. For example, "Oh, Seth put me in group 'no updates for you'... I thought he just didn't use facebook *cry*" That's, of course, a made up example. I love everyone :)
