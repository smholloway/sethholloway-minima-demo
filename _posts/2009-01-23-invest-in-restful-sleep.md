We spend 1/3 of our lives sleeping, so why not enjoy that time? Beyond being a large part of our life, sleep is essential to proper brain function. Sleep affects memory, mood, and physical performance to name a few. Modern scientists recommend 7-8 hours of sleep per night, although before the advent of lights, humans slept 10-12 hours per night.

I was not a believer myself until last summer. I slept on a $400 mattress+box springs, and I planned to continue doing so until several years after the bed rotted into nothingness. However, that plan did not work for my wife. She encouraged me to go try new mattresses, so we did. The difference between the bed I had and the pricier ($800+) beds was remarkably apparent! It took me another couple days of thinking, but finally I decided to invest in restful sleep. (I got a <a title="Tempurpedic dot com" href="http://www.tempurpedic.com/" target="_blank">Tempurpedic</a> if you're wondering.) Since then I have slept much more soundly and been more comfortable.

Hopefully Ive convinced you, or you already know, that sleep is important. However, very few people invest in restful sleep. For instance, a nice bed. Beds are relatively cheap with expensive mattresses still coming in under $5,000. Compare that price to a car which can easily reach six figures--and you probably spend far less time in your car. I assure you the ROI of restful sleep is huge. A comfortable bed is worth every penny!

Do you believe? Have you upgraded your bed yet? When do you get the most restful sleep? Does the bed make a difference?
