The United States provides <a title="US Census aid numbers" href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/foreign_commerce_aid/foreign_aid.html" target="_blank">billions of dollars of aid to foreign nations every year</a>. It is questionable whether or not the aid is truly helping the people and if recipients are grateful for the assistance. For example, <a title="Why U.S. Farm Subsidies Are Bad for the World" href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0506-09.htm">some say</a> that giving food to agricultural nations actually reduces their ability to make money and improve themselves.

Rather than debate the current structure, why don't we use that money to fund trips abroad? American teens could have a federally funded <a title="Wikipedia: Gap Year" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year">gap year</a>. As these travelers spend, they generate new jobs and bring up the people in the nations they visit. They might also gain some perspective and change the attitude that we're Ugly Americans.

What do you think, best idea ever? :)

For a glimpse at one can happen when you distribute food to hungry people check out the <a title="Anthony Bourdain No Reservations 10m in" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6gmB-jYd-c#at=600">No Reservations Haiti episode (10 minutes in)</a>.
