I struggle with when to include the PhD suffix. I try not to flaunt my degree, but I worked hard and want the PhD to be worth something--that means I can't downplay it. Work is one place where degrees (might) matter. There are potential downsides to using the PhD at work though.

Here's roughly when I include (marked yes) or omit (marked no) the PhD:

 * Resume: yes
 * Email signature: yes
 * Business card: yes
 * Presentations (title slide): yes
 * LinkedIn: no
 * Name tags: no
 * Verbal introductions: no

Does that seem reasonable to you? Have a missed a situation? I suppose the tried-and-true advice is "know your audience" and use the PhD when it will be advantageous.
