Some creative types advocate a method to increase creativity by writing a poem a day forevermore. Here's my effort to increase my creativity and avoid perfectionism.
<h2>Sunday</h2>
Haikus are easy

Not easy, but straightforward

I just penned one
<h2>Monday</h2>
Perfection is good

Shipped is preferable

Why not try for both?
<h2>Tuesday</h2>
Now uninspired

Creativity in waves

Better than ever
<h2>Wednesday</h2>
Sassy Daisy-May

Loves long walks, runs, and car rides

Cuddling next to me
<h2>Thursday</h2>
Social media

Ahhhhhh LinkedIn, Facebook, GitHub

Not enough time for them
<h2>Friday</h2>
Televise e-sports

Power to the nerdy folks

Stop praising athletes
<h2>Saturday</h2>
No photographs please

I am not wearing makeup

Wait, I never do
