I recently increased my activity on Twitter (meaning I started following a lot of people). After my flurry of activity I noticed something strange: for roughly every 10 people I followed, I had about 1 person follow me. Notice I did not say "follow me back." In my case, these were some kind of bots that randomly follow people. I checked and they did not have people in common so it's not like they just follow everyone that Guy Kawasaki follows, but there's a definite spike in following based on twitter activity.

Here's a crudely formatted profile from one of the spammers:

Whenever you navigate to Loren's profile page, you see a link to an adult site. I'm baffled by the whole situation. Some questions keeping me up at night:

<em>What is the ROI on an outfit like this?</em> Sure, you can automate virtually everything and you can mechanical turk out captcha solving and account creation for pennies, but do you gain anything from a twitter bot that randomly follows people (and nothing else)?

<em>What is the purpose of following people?</em> It seems they simply want to drive traffic, but in the example above only 516 people would have seen the site. As I understand it, you won't gain any search engine cred beyond the twitter backlink (some think that retweets--abbreviated RT--might convey some power), and the bot's <a title="Klout for the twitter bot" href="http://klout.com/#/lorendisorda710">Klout score is insignificant</a> at 0-1 so they have virtually no influence.

<em>Who would a real person follow these spammers back?</em> With 0 tweets the bots are simply not adding any value, so why would you want to connect with them? If you google for twitter users who follow back, you'll find a lot of people willing to trade follows. The most ridiculous I saw was a guy claiming that he would win a car if he could get enough followers. If you simply want to game the system and appear larger than life, this is one way to do it I guess... I'd guess a lot of the people following the bots are bots themselves.

<em>Why not automate tweeting too?</em> The programmers clearly have the Twitter API down, so why not pause for a random number of seconds then tweet something like, "&lt;site name&gt; is &lt;adjective to draw people in&gt;" and repeat. Even 1000 nearly identical tweets would look more reputable than 0.

<em>How many accounts have been banned for the bot masters to fine-tune this process?</em> I suspect that following too many people at once would trigger a bot alarm and get your account banned; perhaps automated tweeting can be detected and squashed too. Given the amount of utter garbage being generated in bite-sized chunks, I don't think they have a filter in place :)

<em>Capitalization and punctuation, really?</em> I must admit that I have a better impression of this twitter bot than I did of some previous ones that with descriptions that were hardly English. Again, I imagine this is a data driven decision so I would love to know how many accounts they tried with broken English/poor grammar and punctuation. Did foreigners and young people relate more to the informal style?

<em>Who is behind twitter bots?</em> Is this all the work of HBGary and their persona management system under development when they were hacked by Anonymous? Probably not! I suspect the people in charge are not that sophisticated, although their motives are unclear to me.

<em>How are the names chosen?</em> I figured the names were random, but then I dug a bit deeper. Interestingly enough, <a title="Klout for lorendisorda70" href="http://klout.com/#/lorendisorda70">@lorendisorda70 is a fairly popular person</a> so the @lorendisorda710 handle may be a ploy to attract typo prone or easily confused users.

Anyone have any thoughts?
