My father once told me that I should reply, "Unbelievable!" anytime someone queried about my mood. The logic behind this was simple: the definition of "unbelievable" can fit any situation and people interpret the response positively. In general, people like to be around fun, positive people, so your "unbelievable" reply starts you off on the right foot.

Today, like most days, I'm unbelievable, and I hope you are too!
