According to <a title="Frank Levy" href="http://web.mit.edu/flevy/www/">Frank Levy</a>, <a title="Frank Levy's lecture at Swarthmore" href="http://web.mit.edu/flevy/www/Bernie%20Saffran%20Swarthmnore%20Lecture.pdf">the New World economy is not kind to anyone but the elite</a>Â (economics start on page 4). This does not bode well for the future.

Levy is doing very interesting research on the changing world market. I'm particularly fond of neo-skilled labor. His research matches almost perfectly with several debates I've had with other engineers--I wish I would have read the studies earlier so I could bring a different perspective.

I find it somewhat ironic that Dr. Levy is leading the charge into the changing global economy when he and his kin are extremely well educated (his wife is a professor at Harvard, his son is an MBA, and his daughter is a lawyer). Do the unwashed masses already know the simple truths that Dr. Levy espouses? Did academia just open the door into reality or is this truly new?
