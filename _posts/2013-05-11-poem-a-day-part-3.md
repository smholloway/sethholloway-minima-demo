<h2>Sunday</h2>
Countless thoughts to share

Until I'm at the keyboard

Then it just dries up
<h2>Monday</h2>
Off me hungry cat

I'll feed you when I wake up

Until then, shutup
<h2>Tuesday</h2>
Haters gonna hate

Eagerly trolling people

Keep daring greatly
<h2>Wednesday</h2>
You can do an'thing

Except defy gravity

That's natural law
<h2>Thursday</h2>
Onward and upward

Or perhaps out and over

Life's path's uncharted
<h2>Friday</h2>
Chinese twice today

Tongue and belly are happy

Heart and scale are mad
<h2>Saturday</h2>
Today I ran miles

Slow down, breathe, focus, and go

Push to run longer
