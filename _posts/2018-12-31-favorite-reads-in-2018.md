<p>Below are my favorite <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210120073302/https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/10936110">reads from 2018</a>. In 2018 my reading focused a lot on improving myself in order to make me a better husband, father, manager, and all-around person.</p>

<p>Over the years I’ve read a lot about management, however, a lot of it is very high level. I read and enjoyed <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210120073302/https://www.radicalcandor.com/">Radical Candor</a> by Kim Scott because it provided an opinionated overview of how to manage like when and how to have career conversations. I found a lot of the suggestions helpful as I officially began my management career.</p>

<p>I finished the available <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210120073302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Years_of_Lyndon_Johnson">LBJ biographies by Robert A. Caro</a>, which I highly recommend. Between those and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210120073302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dictator%27s_Handbook">The Dictator’s Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics</a> by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita I had a new framework for interpreting today’s political landscape.</p>

<p>On the non-fiction front, I read and enjoyed the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210120073302/http://nnedi.com/books/binti.html">Binti</a> series and the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210120073302/https://www.goodreads.com/series/192752-bobiverse">Bobiverse</a> series. Both were quick, thought-provoking sci-fi series.</p>
