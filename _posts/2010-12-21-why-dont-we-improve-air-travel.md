Everyday, millions of people fly. I'd guess most everyone hates the process. As with most things in life, happy people make everything better (they're more productive, etc)--and it's contagious!

Terminals

 * Better seating
 * More A/C outlets
 * Free wifi
 * Smoking rooms

Flights

 * Allow people to use electronic devices the whole time
 * Turn on the entertainment system and A/C before passengers board and leave them on until people are off the plane
 * USB charging stations on each seat
 * Assigned overhead bins
 * Some sane amount of free alcohol (maybe 1 drink per 4 hours)
 * A light snack (research points to about 300 calories per 3 hours)
 * Treat people like adults!

There are some other ideas in <a title="Salon" href="http://www.salon.com/technology/ask_the_pilot/2010/09/15/airplane_seating/index.html" target="_blank">this article on Salon</a>.

Beyond these, improved communication and more travel options would be fantastic.Â What would you like to see?
