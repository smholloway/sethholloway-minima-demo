In October I continued onÂ <a title="Wikipedia: The Wheel of Time" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time">The Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan</a>, completing books two and three (a grand total of about 1500 pages). So far I'm really liking the series, which is a fantasy hero story. As of now I still prefer <a title="Wikipedia: A Song of Fire and Ice" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire">A Song of Fire and Ice by G.R.R.M.</a>. A Song of Fire and Ice takes more risks--perhaps because the series is less about good and evil (or it is not so obvious who is truly good or evil). In any case, I will complete the Robert Jordan (then Brandon Sanderson) series.
