I created a [repo in hopes of it becoming the most
starred](https://github.com/smholloway/do-it-for-all-of-us/tree/master) repo on
GitHub. That's a pretty audacious goal, I know.
[Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) currently
has over 64,000 stars, making it the [most popular repository on
GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=stars%3a%3E1&s=stars&type=Repositories).

Just check out [@mdo's profile page](https://github.com/mdo):

So many stars! What a badass. Who doesn't want cred like that? Now we
can all have it, or at least part of it. We're not going to make an
important product, but we can get a lot of stars â˜»

Please join me in my quest to the top. Do it for me. Do it for yourself.
[Do it for all of us](http://doitforallof.us/).
