When I get good at something I tend to lose empathy for beginners. I'm not unique in that regard. Reflecting on negative experiences, it was often when a senior person made me feel dumb for being new. This happens at work, in life, even in school (how many college profs answer questions gracefully?).

To counteract the loss of connection, I think it is important to always be aÂ novice at something. Said another way, always be learning.
