Chances are, you don't know if you have something in your teeth because no one will tell you. It's embarrassing. It's intimate. It's real.

If you do not have a friend who will tell you that you have something in your teeth, get one. If you will not return the courtesy to your good friends, change! Life is greatly enriched by deep social interactions.

Thanks to all my friends who treat me with respect, fairness, and honesty--my teeth would not be so clean without you all :)
