For anyone that is not my "friend" in Google Reader you can still see posts that I find interesting/useful: <a title="Seth Holloway's shared stories" href="https://www.google.com/reader/shared/11451882993897049685" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/reader/shared/11451882993897049685</a>

The page is automatically generated, up-to-date, and anonymous for the surfer, so feel free to check it out. Alternatively, set up the always useful <a title="Google Reader" href="https://www.google.com/reader/" target="_blank">Google Reader</a>, friend me, and we can see one another's shared posts. It's a great way to let other people sift through the stories and share the gems.
