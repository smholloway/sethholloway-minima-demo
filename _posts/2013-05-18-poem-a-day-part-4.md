<h2>Sunday</h2>
Can I make one rhyme

Easy enough this one time

Twice would be a crime
<h2>Monday</h2>
Authentication

Usable security

My new job, Toopher
<h2>Tuesday</h2>
Deer in the greenbelt

Just hanging out and sleeping

What a peaceful scene
<h2>Wednesday</h2>
What is modern rock?

Black Keys, Muse, Mumford and Sons

Radio needs variety
<h2>Thursday</h2>
Sunny and real hot

It is summer in Texas

Gonna get sweaty
<h2>Friday</h2>
Good end to the week

Kayaking to the sunset

Outdoors in Austin
<h2>Saturday</h2>
What the?! Up is down...

Stupid reverse scrolling Mac

Why do I love you?
