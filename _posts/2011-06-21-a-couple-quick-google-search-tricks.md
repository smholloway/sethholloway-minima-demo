I recently stumbled upon these tricks and thought others might find them interesting too; for example, I now know that I'm the top hit for people searching for Seth Holloway in France.

To see results from a different location you can either

 * go to the Google site you're interested in and append "ncr" to the URL (e.g., http://www.google.co.kr/ncr to see Korean search results) or
 * use the gl=&lt;two letter location&gt; parameter (e.g., http://www.google.com/search?q=blah&amp;gl=KR).

To avoid personalization - add the `pws=0` flag

I found a nice example from an <a title="SEOmoz - how can I view google..." href="http://www.seomoz.org/q/how-can-i-view-google-com-serps-from-outside-the-us">SEOmoz article on how to retrieve results for a specific location without actually being in that location</a>:
<blockquote>Use this as a model: http://www.google.com/search?q=your+search+query&amp;pws=0&amp;gl=US (obviously put your search query in where it says your+search+query (separated by plus signs)).

Broken down:

www.google.com - the search engine you want

pws=0 - remove any personalization

gl=US - return results as if you were in the US
