[Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004H1TQBW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004H1TQBW&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20&linkId=3QW5ERP7I3H66ZG6).
A solid fantasty novel with an interesting magic system. In Mistborn, a
select few people are gifted with the ability to burn a metal internally
granting them abilities like improved strength or improved hearing. The
elevated ability lasts as long as the metal remains with the metal
burning in proportion to the power you demand of it. An even smaller
group can burn all metals. I liked it a lot.

[The Art of Conflict Management by Michael
Dues](http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/art-of-conflict-management-achieving-solutions-for-life-work-and-beyond.html). 
I now think that conflict management is the most important skill a
person can have. I wish this stuff was taught in school! It was very
helpful for me to learn the basics, which provided me with a framework
for understanding conflict ("discomforting differences").

[Finding Your Element by Sir Ken
Robinson](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AFPVOTG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00AFPVOTG&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20&linkId=JWTMJY6TXCVPZDCO). Ken Robinson had a great
tech talk, so I thought I'd like the book. It was good, but not really
what I need. I'd recommend the book to young people who are floundering as they embark on
adulthood or middle-aged people struggling to understand where they fit
into the scheme of things.

[No More Mr. Nice Guy by Robert
Glover](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004C438CW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004C438CW&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20&linkId=7XHAOVDX33VKT7OV). I don't know how to feel about this book. I think it has a lot of really good information for nice guys who are unfulfilled; however, it raises some questions regarding masculinity and being kind but firm. Some of the positive points: men should spend time with other men, people should stand up for themselves and they should get what they want, and couples should evenly divide work.
