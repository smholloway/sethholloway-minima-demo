Effective, safe driving is all about processing information and communicating with your driving peers. Brake lights let those behind you know that you're slowing down--and they're pretty good at that. Why don't we have gas lights to know when people ahead of you are speeding up? For even more information, vehicles could indicate when neither the gas pedal or brake pedal is being pressed.
