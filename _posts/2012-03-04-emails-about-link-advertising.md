In the past couple months I have received numerous emails to post a link on the site. I am confused by the emails and wonder if others have received similar inquiries. Based on the emails, it seems to be coming from a single person or company who will not reveal themselves--shady!

The emails are very similar:

 * the emails refer to a post and provide a subtle compliment
 * the emails are sent from a generic name with an email address that is in the form &lt;first name&gt;.&lt;last name&gt;@gmail.com
 * the emails offer $25-$50 paid via PayPal to post a link on the site
 * the emails are asking for a link to an education site
 * the emails close with a quote from a famous person

Here are a few examples:

<blockquote>Hey,

I just finished reading your post , 'Learning HTML/CSS (web design)' and really enjoyed it!

Do you do advertising? I'm marketing out a site and can pay you via PayPal for adding a few text links to an old post. These links would go to resources on education and topics related to the theme of your post.

Let me know if we can work something out! :)

Thanks

<blockquote>Dear Seth Holloway,
I just got done checking out your "Learning HTML/CSS (web design)" and I found it really interesting!  Do you do advertising? I'm marketing out a few sites and can pay you $50 via PayPal to add a text link into one of your older posts.  The link would go to an education site and I'd make sure the site relates to your post's content
Thanks and let me know if we can work something out!

I try to be courteous and reply to emails, so I replied to "Madison" who ultimately replied as "Maxine" -- whoops!
Has anyone else seen similar emails? Any idea who is behind this campaign?
