What is the resolution of unaltered human sight? Computers are slowly pushing their capability higher: from 800x600 to 1920x1200 and beyond. I'm left wondering "When will the screen resolution catch our innate capabilities?"

The answer is not simple and estimates differ on the resolution (<a title="acuity, resolution, ...what now?" href="http://www.clarkvision.com/imagedetail/eye-resolution.html" target="_blank">324 megapixel</a>, <a title="deviantart estimate of human resolution" href="http://news.deviantart.com/article/27174/" target="_blank">576 megapixels</a> to <a title="vision" href="http://www.swift.ac.uk/vision.pdf" target="_blank">15 million megapixels</a>). In any case, our eyes will outperform technology for at least another year or two :) That's when genetic engineering can save the day!
