I was just cleaning the apartment and I realized that my simple life is full of clutter--every week I pick up the same few items and throw them away. Among the offenders are

 * Plastic bags (groceries)
 * Plastic water bottles
 * Magazines
 * Junk mail

Most of those can be recycled... somewhere, somehow... Unfortunately, I do not have any convenient way of disposing of these items in a more environmentally-friendly way (and as much as I care about the environment, I don't want to store boxes of stuff, find the drop-off locations, and then make multiple separate trips). I've been searching (reading and brainstorming) for clever ways to use these items, but I have not found much. <a title="tips to improve your life, or waste your time" href="http://www.lifehack.org/">Lifehack</a> had an article on <a title="10 ways to reuse plastic bags" href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/10-uses-for-plastic-grocery-bags.html" target="_blank">10 ways to reuse plastic bags</a>. If you have any ideas, please let me know!
