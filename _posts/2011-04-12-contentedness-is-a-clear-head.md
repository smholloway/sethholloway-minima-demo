People complain a lot about being under-appreciated. I think this is because good people do not necessarily stand out. It is often true that the squeaky wheel gets the grease. After some pondering, I believe that it is actually the people that require the least thought from a boss that are the best workers. The best compliment you can give someone is then that you don't have to worry about them. They allow your mind to be free so you can pursue more important or pleasurable thoughts. Take a moment to think about the people that you don't have to think about--the friend you can call anytime, the customer that always pays on time, the boss that stays out of your hair--now, thank them.
