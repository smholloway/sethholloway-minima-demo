[Kitchen Confidential by Anthony
Bourdain](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060899220/ref=as_li_tl?tag=theven01-20). I loved the insight into the restaurant industry. Bourdain is a really good writer, which complements his crass, honest style. If you want to know what the people in the kitchen are up to, read this book.

[The Forbidden Tower by Marion Zimmer
Bradley](http://www.amazon.com/gp/B0010U3Z3S/ref=as_li_tl?tag=theven01-20). Apparently this is the worst of the Darkover series, so it's unfortunate that it is where I started. I'm not sure I'll continue the series.

[Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern #2) by Anne
McCaffrey](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345335082/ref=as_li_tl?tag=theven01-20). Meh. I liked this book when I read it, but I don't have overwhelmingly positive memories now.

[Collected Fictions by Jorge Luis
Borges](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140286802/ref=as_li_tl?tag=theven01-20). Sol Stein raved about [Borges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges), and Borges sounded like an author worth reading. Short stories are really different for me because I normally read technical books or novels. That said, I found Borges' stories to be interesting.

[Street Smarts: An All-Purpose Tool Kit for Entrepreneurs by Norm
Brodsky and Bo
Burlingham](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591843200/ref=as_li_tl?tag=theven01-20). Following Lean Startup I was feeling entrepreneurial and this book looked good. It was good. Lots of good lessons. I've noticed that a lot of business books rely on personal anecdotes from a single success; it's not bad, and I understand that making millions of dollars over many years would certainly teach you a lot, but it is odd when every lesson takes you back to a story from a single company.

[Monster Hunter Vendetta by Larry
Correia](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439133913/ref=as_li_tl?tag=theven01-20). I've now started two
Correia series (Grimnoir and Monster Hunters), and I really like both.
He writes really fun, fast-paced books that remind me of action movies.
I'll be reading more of these as soon as I clear out my queue.
