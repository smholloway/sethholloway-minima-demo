My sister received her PhD last Spring. She completed the highest level of schooling in a difficult field at one of the top 10 best institutions in the world. Wow! That's awesome by anyone's metrics! Yet, at the terminal degree graduation ceremony (that packed a college basketball arena) attendees were completely civilized (quiet). As Allison strode across the stage I let out a loud whoop! of approval and felt eyes on me for my social outburst.

Months later, this still bothers me. Why don't we (civilized Americans) cheer loudly when people accomplish big things? I'm not sure any amount of noise could truly capture the the effort Allison put in and pride that we all felt, but that shouldn't stop us from whooping and hollaring with merriment.

The next time someone you love accomplishes something big, celebrate loud and proud!
