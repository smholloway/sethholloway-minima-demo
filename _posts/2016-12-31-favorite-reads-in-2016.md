<p>Below are my favorite reads from 2016.</p>

<h3>Fiction</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210120073302/http://amzn.to/1RX9aIm">Lord of All Things</a> by Andreas Eschbach – This book had a lot of new-to-me ideas and the sci-fi was integrated nicely into a story I enjoyed. One of the things that stands out is that tradeoffs exist with every choice.</li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210120073302/http://amzn.to/2ixJgRY">Seveneves</a> by Neal Stephenson – Amazing concepts that my mind keeps turning over. I love Neal Stephenson and this is yet another mind-expanding novel from him. This book really hit him as Elon Musk started speaking more publicly about getting off Earth.</li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210120073302/http://amzn.to/2in6xFW">Stories of Your Life and Others</a> by Ted Chiang – I don’t tend to read many short stories, but I’m glad I read this collection. About half the stories were really good and still have me thinking.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Series</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210120073302/http://amzn.to/1YefYmk">Red Rising by Pierce Brown</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210120073302/http://amzn.to/1UHiSBW">Riyria Chronicles by Michael J. Sullivan</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210120073302/http://amzn.to/2iWcyur">Lightbringer series by Brent Weeks</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Non-fiction</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210120073302/http://amzn.to/294eAPo">Them: Adventures with Extremists</a> by Jon Ronson – A great story in the midst of a very extreme 2016.</li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210120073302/http://amzn.to/2hHFvrV">Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character</a> by Richard Feynman – This is my new standard for an autobiography. Entertaining and interesting throughout, with great insights into this curious character. I particularly liked that he didn’t want more money because it would allow him to afford mistress, which he knew would ruin his life.</li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210120073302/http://amzn.to/2iUcmre">Home Game: An Accidental Guide to Fatherhood</a> by Michael Lewis – I would recommend this to any new father. It’s short and funny with Michael Lewis plainly saying so many things I had thought. I’ve used his question “what percentage of the parenting does each parent do?” several times now. He says that fathers do much less than mothers but there’s a lot of social stigma to admitting that, which made me feel better.</li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210120073302/http://amzn.to/2in8Et5">When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for Difficult Times</a> by Pema Chodron – This book dovetailed nicely with my efforts to control my emotions. I read no more than one chapter at a time because it’s heavy, introspective stuff. I was thrilled that I read this beeok when I saw Derek Sivers mention Pema Chodron in his <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210120073302/http://nownownow.com/about">about now pages post</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>That’s my not-so-short list of favorites from 2016. I hope 2017 will be filled with as many great stories.</p>
