This book felt like a slog, but ended really well. Some friends advised I skip the middle, so I think I'll read summaries before jumping to book 12 to start the finale.

Robin Williams shows how to transform boring, bad designs using CRAP--that's contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. The second edition is a bit dated; perhaps the third edition is closer to today's flat UI trend.

I wish I would have read this earlier, but I probably wouldn't have gotten much out of it because I didn't think I needed it. I found that the deep dives into new subjects that I frequently did during my PhD is called syntopical reading.

As with many business books, you could summarize it in one blog post, but then you lose the nuance. I'm curious how Drucker would argue that a busy executive should read his entire book instead of a concise summary.

This was a quick read with some interesting points. I was intrigued by thinking about whose problem something is and how decision makers' interests rarely align with he people experiencing the problem.
