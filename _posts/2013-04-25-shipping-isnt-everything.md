Stop bragging about how much you shipped!

I understand that code does not generate revenue unless people are using it. I appreciate getting product out the door. I also love clean code a solid architecture that reduces maintenance costs and allows developers to stay productive for years to come. I cannot abide the "ship or die" mentality when people ship hacky, unusable software then play the "shipping is everything" card.

Not all shipping is a success. <a title="Wikipedia: Chinese milk scandal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Chinese_milk_scandal">China shipped melamine-laced milk</a> that made a ton of people sick. <a title="Wikipedia: Madoff Investment Scandal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoff_investment_scandal">Madoff shipped a lot of information</a> that led to financial ruin. <a title="NPR: Komen and Planned Parenthood" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/01/31/146177902/furor-erupts-over-susan-g-komen-halt-of-grants-to-planned-parenthood">Komen shipped their plan to cut funding to Planned Parenthood</a> and faced a great backlash. <a title="Wikipedia: Mars Climate Orbiter" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter">NASA shipped code with metric-imperial unit mismatch</a> and crashed a $300,000,000 rover. <a title="Wikipedia: Microsoft Clippy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant">Microsoft shipped Clippy</a> and people cringed. A little oversight before shipping can save lives and prevent PR nightmares.

Let's stop glorifying shipping and start glorifying quality, happiness (for clients and employees), and success.
