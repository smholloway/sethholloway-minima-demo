What do elephants, humans, and bacteria have in common? Probably a lot, but the answer I'm looking for is the amount of energy we use. Scientists have found that <a title="Wired article" href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/10/scientists-comp.html" target="_blank">all living things use roughly the same amount of energy</a>. It seems this study contradicts earlier research. I'm interested to find out more, especially after reporting on <a title="Seth Holloway dot com: Tardigrade" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=103" target="_blank">Tardigrade </a>that can survive all kinds of crazy conditions. Even humans seem to burn different amount of energy (think of the skinny guy who can eat anything), although I doubt that's an order of magnitude different among species.
