Over the years I have played with a few different resume styles. I had the <a title="Seth Holloway's outdated LaTeX resume" href="https://github.com/smholloway/resume/tree/master/latex">LaTeX template</a>, the <a title="Seth Holloway's timeline resume" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/timelineResume.html">timeline resume</a>, the <a title="Seth Holloway's responsive design resume" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/resume.html">responsive resume</a> (resize your browser or check it out on your phone), and the old school World of Warcraft character builder style resume. This post is meant to showcase the RPG character builder resume that I never publicized. Check it out:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1869" alt="Seth Holloway Character Builder Resume Screenshot" src="/images/Screenshot-February-16-2013.png" width="505" height="439" /></a>

If the screenshot leaves you wanting, you can see my <a title="Seth Holloway RPG Character Builder Resume" href="http://sethholloway.com/alternativeResume.html">RPG style resume live</a> and check out <a title="WoW character builder" href="http://wowtal.com/#k=ff-.bqj.druid.">World of Warcraft Character Builder</a> for the inspiration.

I've also <a title="Seth Holloway's resumes on GitHub " href="https://github.com/smholloway/resume">open sourced the resumes</a>. The individual READMEs there provide some more information about each template. I hope others will find this interesting and valuable.

As always, please post your questions and comments :)
