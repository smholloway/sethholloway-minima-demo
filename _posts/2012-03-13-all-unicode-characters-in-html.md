<a title="The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">Joel Spoelsky's article on what developers should know</a> motivated me to learn a bit about <a title="Wikipedia: Unicode" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> characters. To explore this awesome encoding I wrote a little <a title="Seth Holloway's HTML experiment with unicode" href="https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/blob/master/javascript/funWithUnicode.html">JavaScript to print out all the Unicode characters</a>. It is interesting to note where you have significant gaps of blank white blocks with black borders (this shows what character sets you lack--sorry, I have not noted which set is displayed in the page). Be patient: the page takes a few seconds to run.
