There's an idea of rockstar developers--lots of companies are looking for them (evidenced by <a title="Google: Rock star developer" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=rock-star+developer">this search</a>).  If you don't know what I'm talking about, see these related posts: <a title="Google: rockstar developer" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=rock-star+developer">Google: rockstar developer</a>, <a title="Top 10 traits of a rockstar software engineer" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/top_10_software_engineer_traits.php">Top 10 Traits of a Rockstar Software Engineer</a>, <a title="You don't really want a rockstar" href="http://www.pseudocoder.com/blog/you-dont-really-want-a-rock-star">You Don't Really Want a Rock Star</a>, <a title="The case against rock star developers" href="http://www.stephenforte.net/PermaLink,guid,c0bdc70a-8e84-4339-ab44-4f4fefed8617.aspx">The case against Rock Star developers</a>.

People seem to equate rockstars with singers, but there are plenty of rock-stars that aren't the frontmen. Are you the steady bassist, grooving and keeping everyone on time? Are you the guitarist who steps in for a solo then falls back to some tasty licks? If you're not the lead singer, don't fret: you can be a rockstar in more than one way!

What's your place in the band? What terms of you tired of seeing in software?
