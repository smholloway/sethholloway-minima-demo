This morning I was inspired by a speech from <a title="wikipedia: Dave Eggers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Eggers" target="_blank">Dave Eggers</a>, one of three 2008 TED prize ($100,000) winners. In <a title="Dave Eggers in 4 minutes on TED" href="http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/dave_eggers_in.php" target="_blank">this clip</a> Dave talks about how we, the people, can help the educational system. The idea is simple:

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/l3QbzvT6vko&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/l3QbzvT6vko&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

As you'll see in the video, Austin has a similar center called the <a title="Austin Bat Cave" href="http://www.austinbatcave.org/Home.html" target="_blank">Austin Bat Cave</a>. (Apparently it's not officially <a title="wikipedia: 826 National" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/826_National" target="_blank">826 National</a>, but it follows in the same vein.)

I think Dave has an excellent, inspirational idea that should be replicated all over. Anyone interested in starting the central Austin center?
