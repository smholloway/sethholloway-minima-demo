[The Road by Cormac
McCarthy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OI0G1Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000OI0G1Q&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20&linkId=GO6FQAOF57SDDYD4). A short but powerful book--I see why it was made into a movie. Turns out the apocalypse is no fun.

[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater by Kurt
Vonnegut](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IHWBSY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005IHWBSY&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20&linkId=27ID6XF3TZLBRUHR). I'm ashamed to admit that this is my first Vonnegut book. I've broken the seal, and I enjoyed it. The book has a socialist bent, so I'd love to hear what a strong capitalist thought of this book.

[Gone Girl by Gillian
Flynn](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006LSZECO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B006LSZECO&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20&linkId=CTUBO5ECTNQJQN3S). I finished this before seeing the movie. My overall reaction is, "wow." I didn't like it, then liked it, then loved it, then didn't like it. It was original and well written, for what that's worth.

[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick
Lencioni](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787960756/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0787960756&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20).
I've now read a few Lencioni books, and I really enjoy them. I find his novel
approach to business lessons is very accessible. This book says you need
to first establish trust so that people will speak freely. Without
trust, people cannot engage in productive arguments, so people do not
buy in--they just quit arguing. Once you have trust, an open exchange of
ideas, and commitment to a shared vision, you can start holding people
accountable. Finally, you can focus on results. The five dysfunctions
are presented as a pyramid, which highlights the need to achieve the
previous level before moving up--I thought that was kind of like
[Maslow's Hierarchy of
Needs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs) applied
to business.
