Last year I interviewed several places and saw several different styles.

One question that I thought was subtle yet effective was, "what do you read?" I think you can learn a lot about a person based on this question. Personally, I read a ton online but few printed words, so my answer would be very different than a friend of mine who reads tons of fiction plus scholarly papers (very few blogs or general news). Most companies probably don't want to hire someone that reads all day--you have to get work done sometime--but someone that stays up-to-date on industry news may perform better as an advisor and someone that reads a wide variety of books may be a good manager.

I felt very at ease asking the question, which is good for both the interviewee and the interviewer. I think we should find out as much as possible about both sides, as comfortably as possible.

So, what do you read?
