I won't validate the ads by pointing them out, but we can all think of a number of annoying commercials. I suppose the marketeers who generated these wretched pieces truly believe that "no press is bad press." Don't focus groups give feedback? I can't imagine anyone seeing such choice pieces of advertising and saying, "YEAH! I want to buy X now!"

More and more ads are moving online, but no one knows what works in online advertising. I block obnoxious ads online, but allow non-obtrusive, possibly even helpful, ads. Last night Mike and I discussed when we click on Google ads--and it's not when Google would like us to (i.e. all the time). I have to wonder if I'm the standard user or a corner case. What brave new world awaits us with advertising?

By the way, I avoid most ads by using <a title="download firefox!" href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> with <a title="must have firefox add-on!" href="http://adblockplus.org" target="_blank">Adblock Plus</a>. If you're not already using these two, I'd highly recommend it. (More to come later on this subject.) Opera 10 has built in ad-blocking although I don't find it works as well. To augment the service you can use Admuncher (I don't link because they charge a lot) or any other technique described on <a title="Ad filtering article on wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_filtering" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>.
