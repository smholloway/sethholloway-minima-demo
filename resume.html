                Applied cutting-edge web development techniques to create a RESTful architecture that allows novice developers to quickly and easily create mobile and pervasive computing applications. Combining this architecture with multiple user studies (surveys, paper prototypes, focus groups, and direct observation) I was used to build a usable smart home using Java ME on embedded hardware and Ruby on Rails. The work was presented to hundreds of people at numerous conferences and workshops.
